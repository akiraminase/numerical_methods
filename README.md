# numerical_methods
Basic iterative numerical methods for polynomial solution, matrix operation, interpolation, and etc.

###poly_calc.py
* Iterative methods of find numerical estimation of a polynomial with error tolerance and iteration constrain

###matrix_calc.py
* Gaussian elimination with maximum pivoting to find echelon form of a matrix.
* Find reverse matrix with identity matrix
* LU decomposition of a square matrix

### More to come
* Currently working on Interpolation methods
